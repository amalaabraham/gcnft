# gcnft
gcnft - Welcome to the *G*itHub *C*ommit *NFT* Platform


## Initial Idea
The idea of GCNFT is to create a system that allows people with github commits (i.e. people who make the commits) to covert these commits to NFTs.

* Our system will require users to authenticate with github so that we can confirm they have ownership of a given commit.
* The user can then determine which commit to be created with an NFT (i.e. select a commit from a range of commits).
* We will use IPFS as a storage system for the github commit ID (creating a simple asset, e.g. a text file with the github commit ID)
* The NFT miniting process will then be done against the IPFS asset
* The NFT will then be offered to the user for storage in a blockchain wallet
* The user will then have the ability to trade this NFT in a marketplace.
